    <h1>Introduction</h1>

      Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom
      Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe
      oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and
      grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic
      development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single
      common ancestor.Over 1.5 million living animal species have been
      described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are
      molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there
      are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth.

      Animal body lengths range from 8.5 Î¼m (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft).
      They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their
      environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals
      is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as
      ethology. Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria,
      a highly proliferative clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric
      body plan. The vast majority belong to two large superphyla: the
      protostomes, which includes organisms such as the arthropods, molluscs,
      flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the deuterostomes, which include
      the echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains
      the vertebrates. The simple Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position
      within Bilateria.

      Animals first appear in the fossil record in the late Cryogenian period,
      and diversified in the subsequent Ediacaran. Earlier evidence of animals
      is still controversial; the sponge-like organism Otavia has been dated all
      the way back to the Tonian period, but its identity as an animal is
      heavily contested.[4] Nearly all modern animal phyla became clearly
      established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian
      explosion, which began around 539 million years ago (Mya), and most
      classes during the Ordovician radiation 485.4 Mya. 6,331 groups of genes
      common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen
      from a single common ancestor that lived about 650 Mya during the
      Cryogenian period.
